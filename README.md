# Auction House
 https://mounir313.github.io/AuctionHouse/
## Introduction
' Auction House is a fully responsive marketplace website where users can buy, sell, and search for various items. It provides an easy and intuitive platform for users to browse categories, list items, and search for products, all within a clean and modern layout.'
## User Experience (UX)
The user experience design for Auction House is guided by detailed personas that represent key user groups. Two primary personas—Linda (Vintage Goods Seller) and Alex (Crypto User)—are considered. Below I added screenshots that outline their goals, tasks, user stories, and acceptance criteria to inform feature design and ensure the interface meets their needs.
### User Stories (US)'

### Design Choices -'change as per your needs include old and revised wireframes '
![color pallette]('path to the image file for your colour pallet here')
- I will be using white and blue colour text against the light and primary background colours.
- '- Blue shades (Bootstrap primary colors) convey trust and reliability.
- White backgrounds are used for readability and clean aesthetics. '
- **typography**
- Used Bootstrap's default system fonts (`Segoe UI`, `Tahoma`, `Verdana`) for better compatibility and loading speed.
- Font is modern, clean, and sans-serif for easier reading on all devices.
- **Structure**
- 'notes on any templates or framework used'
- Bootstrap 5.3.2 was used to ensure responsive grid structure and consistent UI components.
- Custom HTML5 semantic structure is implemented for SEO and accessibility.
- Sections are divided logically: Home, Categories, Buy & Sell, and Item Search.
- **Imagery**
- I got the images from different sites on Google, and they are free to use images and logo.
- **Wireframes**
